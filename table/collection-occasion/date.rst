For Date fields, data must be recorded in compliance with the standard format
used across the National Health Data Dictionary; specifically, dates must be
of fixed 8 column width in the format DDMMYYYY, with leading zeros used when
necessary to pad out a value. For instance, 13th March 2008 would appear as
13032008.

If the date the activity was performed is unknown, 09099999 should be used.

See :ref:`Collection Occasion Current Validations <collection-occasion-current-validations>` for validation rules.

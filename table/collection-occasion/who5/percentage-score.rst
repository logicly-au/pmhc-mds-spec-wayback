To obtain a WHO-5 percentage score ranging from 0 to 100, the raw score is
multiplied by 4. A percentage score of 0 represents
worst possible, whereas a score of 100 represents best possible quality of life.

For the Percentage score, the missing value used should be 99.

When reporting individual item scores use ‘99 - Not stated / Missing’

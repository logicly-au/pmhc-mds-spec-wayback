The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural
screening questionnaire about 3-16 year olds. It exists in several versions to
meet the needs of researchers, clinicians and educationalists.

The "1" versions are administered on admission and are rated on the basis of
the proceeding 6 months. The "2" follow up versions are administered on review
and discharge and are rated on the basis of the previous 1 month period. The
versions specified for PMHC MDS reporting are:
- PC1 - Parent Report Measure for Children aged 4-10, Baseline version;
- PC2 - Parent Report Measure for Children and Adolescents aged 4-10, Follow up version;
- YR1 - Youth self report measure (11-17), Baseline version; and
- YR2 - Youth self report measure (11-17), Follow up version.

Version 1 of each of the above is reproduced in `Mental Health National Outcomes
and Casemix Collection: Overview of clinical and self-report measures and data

The K5 Total score is based on the sum of K5 item 1 through 5 (range: 5-25).

The Total score is computed as the sum of the item scores. If any item has not
been completed (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it is excluded from
the calculation and not counted as a valid item. If any item is missing, the
Total Score is set as missing.

For the Total score, the missing value used should be 99.

When reporting individual item scores use ‘99 - Not stated / Missing’

**1 - Safety Plan**
Clients referred to The Way Back may have commenced the process of safety planning as part of their discussions with Emergency Department or Ward staff. Any existing safety plans completed by hospital or staff should be shared with or requested by The Way Back service provider and updated as part of preliminary discussions with The Way Back clients.
Where clients referred to The Way Back have not completed any safety planning prior to their referral this should be completed as a priority once the client has consented to participate in The Way Back. Safety Plans must be updated/developed within the first contact with the client and no later than the second contact.

Safety plans should be reviewed with a client as needed. Each instance of the review and update of a safety plan should be recorded.

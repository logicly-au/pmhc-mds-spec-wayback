The Initial Needs Identification (INI) is a screening process where the underlying issues as well as the presenting issues are uncovered to the extent possible. It is not a diagnostic process but is a determination of the client's risk, eligibility and priority for service, a balancing for the service capacity and client needs
Needs identification can occur via phone, face-to-face interaction or written survey intervention. However, Needs Identification is ongoing and as a client receives care, other needs or circumstances may be identified which require attention by other disciplines. External referral or re-entry onto the waiting list to access the other disciplines may then occur. This question allows for more than one response. The INI must be administered at a minimum at the following points of service participation:
* At the start of The Way Back
* At the six-week or mid-point of the expected support period
* At exit from the service

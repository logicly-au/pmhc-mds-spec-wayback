**Reporting requirements**

**Guide for use**
It is best to record the referral information as soon as the client is referred to an agency/community service as it may be difficult to track this information later.
To assist staff, service providers may find it useful to make a list of the agencies from which they most frequently send referrals and note the corresponding Source of Referral code.
Report the Referral starting with the most relevant or urgent one first. This will help to gain an understanding of the client profile.
Up to 10 referrals out provider type may be reported each instance, from the most important to the least.

**Purpose/context**
Program monitoring, service planning.

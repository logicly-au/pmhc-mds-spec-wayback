Describes the main type of service delivered in the contact, selected from a
defined list of categories.  Where more than service type was provided select
that which accounted for most provider time. Service providers are required
to report on Service Type for all Service Contacts.

*Note: NEC is used for 'Not Elsewhere Classified'. For these records, only use these service types if they cannot be classified by any of the other service options.*

0 - No contact took place
  Only use this code where the service contact is recorded as a no show.

1 - Assessment
  Determination of a person's mental health status and need for mental
  health services, made by a suitably trained mental health professional,
  based on the collection and evaluation of data obtained through interview
  and observation, of a person's history and presenting problem(s).
  Assessment may include consultation with the person's family and concludes
  with formation of problems/issues, documentation of a preliminary
  diagnosis, and a treatment plan.

2 - Structured psychological intervention
  Those interventions which include a structured interaction between a
  client and a service provider using a recognised, psychological method,
  for example, cognitive behavioural techniques, family therapy or psycho
  education counselling. These are recognised, structured or published
  techniques for the treatment of mental ill-health. Structured psychological
  interventions are designed to alleviate psychological distress or
  emotional disturbance, change maladaptive behaviour and foster mental
  health. Structured psychological therapies can be delivered on either an
  individual or group basis, typically in an office or community setting.
  They may be delivered by trained mental health professionals or other
  individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
  requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
  health professional. Structured Psychological Therapies include but are
  not limited to:

  - Psycho-education (including motivational interviewing)
  - Cognitive-behavioural therapies
  - Relaxation strategies
  - Skills training
  - Interpersonal therapy

3 - Other psychological intervention
   Psychological interventions that do meet criteria for structured
   psychological intervention.

4 - Clinical care coordination/liaison
   Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other
   health care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate
   and integrate service delivery to the client with the aim of improving
   their clinical outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary
   health care providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation
   and support services, family, friends, other support people and carers
   and other agencies that have some level of responsibility for the
   client's treatment and/or well being.

5 - Clinical nursing services
  Services delivered by mental health nurses that cannot be described
  elsewhere.  Typically, these aim to provide clinical support to clients
  to effectively manage their symptoms and avoid unnecessary hospitalisation.
  Clinical nursing services include:

  - monitoring a client's mental state;
  - liaising closely with family and carers as appropriate;
  - administering and monitoring compliance with medication;
  - providing information on physical health care, as required and,
    where appropriate, assist in addressing the physical health inequities
    of people with mental illness; and
  - improving links to other health professionals/clinical service providers.

  be described elsewhere. These can include, for example, working with a
  child’s teacher to provide advice on assisting the child in their educational
  environment; working with a young person's employer to assist the young
  person to their work environment.

  *Note: This code should only be used for
  Service Contacts that cannot be described by any other Service Type. It is
  expected that the majority of Service Contacts delivered to children and
  young people can be assigned to other categories.*

7 - Suicide prevention specific assistance NEC
  Services delivered to, or on behalf, of a client who presents with risk of
  suicide that cannot be described elsewhere. These can include, for example,
  working with the person's employers to advise on changes in the workplace;
  working with a young person's teacher to assist the child in their school
  environment; or working with relevant community-based groups to assist the
  client to participate in their activities.

  *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
  described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
  Service Contacts delivered to client’s who have a risk of suicide can be
  assigned to other categories.*

8 - Cultural specific assistance NEC
  Culturally appropriate services delivered to, or on behalf, of an Aboriginal
  or Torres Strait Islander client that cannot be described elsewhere.  These
  can include, for example, working with the client’s community support network
  including family and carers, men’s and women’s groups, traditional healers,
  interpreters and social and emotional wellbeing counsellors.

  *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
  described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
  Service Contacts (see domains below) delivered to Aboriginal or Torres Strait
  Islander clients can be assigned to other categories.*

98 - ATAPS
  Services delivered as part of ATAPS funded referrals that are recorded and/or
  migrated into the PMHC MDS.

  *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that are migrated
  from ATAPS MDS sources that cannot be described by any other Service Type.
  It is expected that the majority of Service Contacts delivered to clients
  from 1st July, 2017 can be assigned to other categories.*

  This response will not be allowed on service contacts delivered after
  30 June 2018. (All ATAPS referrals should have concluded by that date).

  This response will only be allowed on service contacts with the !ATAPS flag.

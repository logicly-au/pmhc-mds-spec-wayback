Service providers should report this item on the basis of future planned or
scheduled contacts with the client. Where this item is recorded as 1 (No
further services planned), the episode should be recorded as completed by:

- the date of the final Service Contact should be recorded as the Episode End
  Date
- the Episode Completion Status field should be recorded as â€˜Treatment
  concluded.

Note that no further Service Contacts can be recorded against an
episode once it is marked as completed. Where an episode has been marked as
completed prematurely, the Episode End Date can be manually corrected to allow
additional activity to be recorded.

Service contacts are not restricted to in-person communication but can include
telephone, video link or other forms of direct communication.

1 - Yes
  This code is to be used for service contacts between a mental health service
  provider and the patient/client in whose clinical record the service contact
  would normally warrant a dated entry, where the patient/client is
  participating.

2 - No
  This code is to be used for service contacts between a mental health service
  provider and a third party(ies) where the patient/client, in whose clinical
  record the service contact would normally warrant a dated entry, is not
  participating.

*Note:* Where a client intended to participate in a service contact but failed
to attend, :ref:`dfn-service_contact_participation_indicator` should be recorded
as '1: Yes' and :ref:`dfn-service_contact_no_show` should be recorded as '1: Yes'.

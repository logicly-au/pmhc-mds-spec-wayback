Requires services to record the date of each contact with the primary nominated professional identified by the client.
At a minimum written advice (email or letter) advising of the client’s participation in The Way Back Support Service must be sent to the primary nominated professional on commencement of the service and at service end.
The contact date is the date of the service provider initiates or responds to a communication with the primary nominated professional.

**Does this imply that there can be multiple dates per episode? If so we need another record**

**Purpose/context**
Program monitoring, service planning, funding and accountability.

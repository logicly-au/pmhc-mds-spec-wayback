This data standard is not applicable to person's aged less than 16 years.

This item refers to the source by which a person derives most (equal to or
greater than 50%) of his/her income. If the person has multiple sources of
income and none are equal to or greater than 50%, the one which contributes
the largest percentage should be counted.

This item refers to a person's own main source of income, not that of a
partner or of other household members. If it is difficult to determine a
'main source of income' over the reporting period (i.e. it may vary over
time) please report the main source of income during the reference week.

Code 7 'Not known' should only be recorded when it has not been possible for
the service user or their carer/family/advocate to provide the information
(i.e. they have been asked but do not know).

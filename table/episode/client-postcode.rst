When collecting the postcode of a person's usual place of residence, the ABS
recommends that 'usual' be defined as: 'the place where the person has or
intends to live for 6 months or more, or the place that the person regards as
their main residence, or where the person has no other residence, the place
they currently reside.'

Postcodes are deemed valid if they are in the range 0200-0299, 0800-9999.

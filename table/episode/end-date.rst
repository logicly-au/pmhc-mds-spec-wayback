- The episode end date must not be before 1st January 2016.

- The episode end date must not be in the future.

An *Episode of Care* may be ended in one of two ways:

- clinically, consequent upon conclusion of treatment for the client and
  discharge from care; or

- administratively (statistically), where contact with the client has been lost
  by the organisation prior to completion of treatment or other factors
  prevented treatment being completed.

*Episode End Date* interacts with two other data items in the PMHC MDS - *Service
Contact - Final*, and *Episode Completion Status*.

*Service Contact - Final*
  Collection of data for *Service Contacts* includes a *Service Contact - Final*
  item that requires the service provider to indicate whether further *Service
  Contacts* are planned. Where this item is recorded as ‘no further services
  planned’, the date of the final *Service Contact* should be recorded as the
  *Episode End Date*.

*Episode Completion Status*
  This field should be recorded as 'Episode closed treatment concluded' when a
  *Service Contact - Final* is recorded. The *Episode Completion Status* field
  can also be manually recorded to allow for administrative closure of episodes
  (e.g., contact has been lost with a client over a prolonged period - see
  *Episode Completion Status* for additional guidance). Where an episode is
  closed administratively, the *Episode End Date* should be recorded as the
  date on which the organisation made the decision to close episode.

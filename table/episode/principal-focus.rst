Describes the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the
current Episode of Care, selected from a defined list of categories.

Service providers are required to report on the 'Principal Focus of Treatment
Plan' for all accepted referrals. This requires a judgement to be made about
the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the current
Episode of Care, made following initial assessment and modifiable at a later
stage. It is chosen from a defined list of categories, with the provider
required to select the category that best fits the treatment plan designed for
the client.

Principal Focus of Treatment Plan is necessarily a judgement made by the
provider at the outset of service delivery but consistent with good practice,
should be made on the basis of a treatment plan developed in collaboration with
the client. It should not be confused with Service Type which is collected at
each Service Contact.

1 - Psychological therapy
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of
  psychological therapy by one or more mental health professionals. This
  category most closely matches the type of services delivered under the
  previous ATAPS program where up to 12 individual treatment sessions, and 18
  in exceptional circumstances, could be provided. These sessions could be
  supplemented by up to 10 group-based sessions.

  The concept of 'mental health professionals' has a specific meaning defined
  in the various guidance documentation prepared to support PHNs in
  implementation of reforms. It refers to service providers who meet the
  requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a qualified
  mental health professional and includes:

  - Psychiatrists
  - Registered Psychologists
  - Clinical Psychologists
  - Mental Health Nurses;
  - Occupational Therapists;
  - Social Workers
  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers.

2 - Low intensity psychological intervention
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
  time-limited, structured psychological interventions that are aimed at
  providing a less costly intervention alternative to 'standard' psychological
  therapy. The essence of low intensity interventions is that they utilise nil
  or relatively little qualified mental health professional time and are
  targeted at people with, or at risk of, mild mental illness. Low intensity
  episodes can be delivered through a range of mechanisms including:

  - use of individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
    requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
    health professional;
  - delivery of services principally through group-based programs; and
  - delivery of brief or low cost forms of treatment by mental health
    professionals.

3 - Clinical care coordination
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of a
  range of services where the overarching aim is to coordinate and better
  integrate care for the individual across multiple providers with the aim of
  improving clinical outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary
  health care providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation and
  support services or other agencies that have some level of responsibility for
  the client’s clinical outcomes. These clinical care coordination and liaison
  activities are expected to account for a significant proportion of service
  contacts delivered throughout these episodes.

  Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other health
  care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate and integrate
  service delivery to the client with the aim of improving their clinical
  outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary health care
  providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation and support
  services, family, friends, other support people and carers and other agencies
  that have some level of responsibility for the client’s treatment and/or
  well-being.

4 - Complex Care Package
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of an
  individually tailored ‘package’ of services for a client with severe and
  complex mental illness who is being managed principally within a primary care
  setting. The overarching requirement is that the client receives an
  individually tailored ‘package’ of services that bundles a range of services
  that extends beyond ‘standard’ service delivery and which is funded through
  innovative, non-standard funding models.
  Note: As outlined in the relevant guidance documentation, only three selected
  PHN Lead Sites with responsibilities for trialling work in this area are
  expected to deliver complex care packages. A wider roll-out may be undertaken
  in the future pending results of the trial.

5 - Child and youth-specific mental health services
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of a
  range of services for children (0-11 years) or youth (aged 12-24 years) who
  present with a mental illness, or are at risk of mental illness. These
  episodes are characterised by services that are designed specifically for
  children and young people, include a broader range of both clinical and
  non-clinical services and may include a significant component of clinical
  care coordination and liaison. Child and youth-specific mental health
  episodes have substantial flexibility in types of services actually delivered.

6 - Indigenous-specific services
  The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around delivery of
  mental health services that are specifically designed to provide culturally
  appropriate services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

7 - Other
   The treatment plan for the client is primarily based around services
   that cannot be described by other categories.

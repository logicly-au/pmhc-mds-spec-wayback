Describes the main focus of the services to be delivered to the client for the
current Episode of Care.

For TWB episodes only the following value can be used:

8 - Psychosocial support
  Episodes of care should be classified as Psychosocial Support (code 8) where
  the treatment plan for the client is primarily based around the delivery of
  psychosocial support services. Psychosocial support services are defined for
  PMHC MDS purposes as services that focus on building capacity and stability
  in one or more of the following areas:

  * social skills and friendships, family connections;
  * managing daily living needs;
  * financial management and budgeting;
  * finding and maintaining a home;
  * vocational skills and goals, including volunteering;
  * educational and training goals;
  * maintaining physical wellbeing, including exercise;
  * building broader life skills including confidence and resilience.

  These services are usually delivered by a range of non-clinical providers
  including peer support workers with lived experience of mental illness

  Services delivered to clients receiving episodes of care classified as
  Psychosocial Support may receive the full range of services as described in
  the Service Contact Type data item, for example, assessment,
  care coordination and so forth.  However, in general, where the Principal
  Focus of Treatment Plan is coded as Psychosocial Support there should be an
  expectation that the majority of services provided will be of a psychosocial
  support nature. Further details on the relationship between the episode of
  care concept and service contacts is available at
  https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/faqs/concepts-processes/data-definitions.html#episode-one-at-a-time

  PHNs may wish to advise specific commissioned organisations solely funded
  from their Psychosocial Support Schedule that all episodes of care should be
  coded as Psychosocial Support, or leave it to the discretion of service providers.

  Clients who are recorded as NDIS recipients would not usually be recorded as
  receiving a Psychosocial Support episode of care.  The National Psychosocial
  Support guidance material states explicitly that these services are designed
  for individuals who have significant psychosocial disability but do not meet
  NDIS eligibility criteria.

  Episodes of care delivered to individuals who are recorded as Continuity of
  Support clients (see below) may be reported as Psychosocial Support.

Where a client is being delivered TWB services and accessing another
support service within the same Service Provider the full ranges of responses
allowed for standard PMHC MDS episodes is available.

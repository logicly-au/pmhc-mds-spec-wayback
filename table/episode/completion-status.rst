In order to use code 1 (Episode closed - treatment concluded) the client must have at least one service contact. All other codes may be applicable even when the client has no service contacts.

0 or Blank - Episode open
  The client still requires treatment and further service contacts are
  required.

1 - Episode closed - treatment concluded
  No further service contacts are planned as the client no longer requires
  treatment.

2 - Episode closed administratively - client could not be contacted
  Further service contacts were planned but the client could no longer be
  contacted.

3 - Episode closed administratively - client declined further contact
  Further service contacts were planned but the client declined further treatment.

4 - Episode closed administratively - client moved out of area
  Further service contacts were planned but the client moved out of the area
  without a referral elsewhere. Where a client was referred somewhere else
  *Episode Completion Status* should be recorded as code 5 (Episode closed
  administratively - client referred elsewhere).

5 - Episode closed administratively - client referred elsewhere
  Where a client still requires treatment, but a different service has been
  deemed appropriate or a client has moved out of the area so has moved to a
  different provider.

6 - Episode closed administratively - other reason
  Where a client is no longer being given treatment but the reason for
  conclusion is not covered above.

*Episode Completion Status* interacts with two other data items in the PMHC MDS
- *Service Contact - Final*, and *Episode End Date*.

*Service Contact - Final*
  Collection of data for *Service Contacts* includes a *Service Contact -
  Final* item that requires the service provider to indicate whether further
  Service Contacts are planned. Where this item is recorded as 'no further
  services planned', the *Episode Completion Status* should be recorded as code
  1 (Episode closed - treatment concluded) code 3 (Episode closed
  administratively - client declined further contact), code 4 (Episode closed
  administratively - client moved out of area), or code 5 (Episode closed
  administratively - client referred elsewhere). Selection of coding option
  should be that which best describes the circumstances of the episode ending.

*Episode End Date*
  Where a Final Service Contact is recorded *Episode End Date* should be
  recorded as the date of the final Service Contact.

Additional Diagnosis gives information on conditions that are significant in
terms of treatment required and resources used during the episode of care.
Additional diagnoses should be interpreted as conditions that affect client
management in terms of requiring any of the following:

-	Commencement, alteration or adjustment of therapeutic treatment
-	Diagnostic procedures
-	Increased clinical care and/or monitoring

Where the client one or more comorbid mental health conditions in addition to
the condition coded as the Principal Diagnosis, record the main condition as
the Additional Diagnosis. 

The following responses have been added to allow mapping of ATAPS data to PMHC
format.

- 100: Anxiety disorders (ATAPS)
- 200: Affective (Mood) disorders (ATAPS)
- 300: Substance use disorders (ATAPS)
- 400: Psychotic disorders (ATAPS)

*Note: These four codes should only be used for Episodes that are migrated
from ATAPS MDS sources that cannot be described by any other Diagnosis.
It is expected that the majority of Episodes delivered to clients
from 1st July, 2017 can be assigned to other diagnoses.*

These responses will only be allowed on episodes where the original
ATAPS referral date was before 1 July 2017

These responses will only be allowed on episodes with the !ATAPS flag.

For further notes on the recording of diagnosis codes see Principal Diagnosis.

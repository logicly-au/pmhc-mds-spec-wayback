*Introduced 1 July 2019*

Similar challenges to Psychosocial Support are faced with the Continuity of
Support initiative. The important issues here are:

* The proposed changes to be made for the Psychosocial Support measure should
  accommodate most requirements for Continuity of Support clients.
* The one important difference is that CoS clients are a highly specific
  cohort – those currently in Commonwealth funded PIR, PHaMS and D2DL measures
  found to be ineligible for the NDIS.  These clients should be readily identified.
* CoS clients need to have a marker in the PMHC MDS data that allows the cohort
  to be identified for separate reporting.

1 - Yes
  The person was a client of the Personal Helpers and Mentors (PHaMs),
  Partners In recovery (PIR) and/or Day to Day Living (D2DL) programs and has
  been found to be ineligible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme
  (NDIS).

2 - No

9 - Not stated/inadequately described

It is expected that most **new clients** recorded as CoS clients will have
their episodes classified as Psychosocial Support.

For existing clients who have an active (not closed) episode of care who
become CoS clients after 1 July 2019, there is no need to close the current
episode.  PHNs may however wish to change the Principal Focus of Treatment
Plan to Psychosocial Support if this better reflects the overall episode goals.
Alternatively, PHNs may choose to close the existing episode and commence a
new episode.  This decision can be made locally.

Services delivered under the new CoS arrangements should be coded as
Psychosocial Support in the Service Contact Type field. This is not intended
to restrict CoS clients to only Psychosocial Support services.  Contact Types
delivered to CoS clients can vary across the full range (e.g., they could
receive psychological therapy-type service contacts).  However, where services
are delivered under the CoS arrangements it is essential that they be coded
as  Psychosocial Support contacts to enable monitoring and reporting of the
new CoS measure.

As the new measure does not commence until 1 July 2019, all clients in
active episodes prior to that date should be coded as ‘No’.  This will be
implemented by Strategic Data in the PMHC MDS as a system-wide change for all
existing clients in active episodes as at 30 June 2019.  Changes made to those
existing clients from 1 July 2019 can then be made locally.

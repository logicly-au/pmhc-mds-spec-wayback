**1 - Safety Plan**

Clients referred to The Way Back may have commenced the process of safety
planning as part of their discussions with Emergency Department or Ward staff.
Any existing safety plans completed by hospital or staff should be shared with
or requested by The Way Back service provider and updated as part of
preliminary discussions with The Way Back clients.
Where clients referred to The Way Back have not completed any safety planning
prior to their referral this should be completed as a priority once the client
has consented to participate in The Way Back.

Safety Plans must be updated/developed within the first contact with the
client and no later than the second contact. Safety plans should be reviewed
with a client as needed. Each instance of the review and update of a safety
plan should be recorded.

Service Providers should choose the most appropriate Support Plan template for
their service. The TWB Tools and Templates provide a sample of one and there
is also the BeyondNow app.

**2 - Support Plan**

All Way Back service providers must work collaboratively with their clients
to develop a Support Plan that articulates:

* the client’s **needs** as assessed using the Support Tools
* the client’s **goals** of participating in The Way Back
* proposed **actions and interventions** planned to address identified needs
  and goals including referrals to be made

In developing a Support Plan, discussion with clients should consider warning
signs, strengths, support mechanisms and strategies that have enabled them to
take the next steps. Needs Identified in this process are to be grouped and
reported in the TWB NI data collection.

A Support Plan must be completed with a client within two weeks of their
consenting to participate in the service. To identify a client’s needs and
build an understanding of what support will be of benefit, all Support Tools
and Measures should be completed prior to completing the Support Plan.
Support Plans are also required to be reviewed at 6 weeks, or a regular basis
throughout the support period to ensure that strategies are current and upon
Service Exit. Each review must be documented.

**Reporting requirements**
The Needs Identification (NI) is a screening process where the psychosocial
needs of a client are identified. It provides the basis for the creation of a
Support Plan and is considered a useful way to help understand client support
needs and service goals.  The needs identified through this process should
inform the clientâ€™s goals and referrals to community-based services.

Needs identification can occur via phone, face-to-face interaction or written
survey intervention. However, Needs Identification is ongoing and as a client
receives care, other needs or circumstances may be identified which require
attention by other disciplines. External referral or re-entry onto the
waiting list to access the other disciplines may then occur. This question
allows for more than one response. The NI must be administered at a minimum
at the following points of service participation:

* At the start of The Way Back
* At the six-week or mid-point of the expected support period
* At exit from the service

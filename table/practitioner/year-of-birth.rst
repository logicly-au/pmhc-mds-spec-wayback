- The year of birth must not be in the future.
- The year of birth must be after 1900.
- If the year of birth is unknown, the following approaches should be used:

  - If the age of the practitioner is known, the age should be used to derive the
    year of birth
  - If the age of the practitioner is unknown, an estimated age of the practitioner should
    be used to estimate a year of birth
  - If the date of birth is totally unknown, use 9999.

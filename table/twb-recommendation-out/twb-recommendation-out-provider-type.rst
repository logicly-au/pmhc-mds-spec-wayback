It is best to record the recommendation information as soon as the client is
recommended to an agency/community service as it may be difficult to track this
information later.

To assist staff, service providers may find it useful to make a list of the
agencies from which they most frequently send recommendations and note the
corresponding Source of Recommendation code.
Report the Recommendation starting with the most relevant or urgent one first.

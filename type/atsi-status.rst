Code 9 is not to be available as a valid answer to the questions but is
  intended for use:

  - Primarily when importing data from other data collections that do not
    contain mappable data.
  - Where an answer was refused.
  - Where the question was not able to be asked prior to completion of
    assistance because the client was unable to communicate or a person who
    knows the client was not available.

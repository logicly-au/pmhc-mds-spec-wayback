    Care that post-dates Episode Start and pre-dates Episode End. An outcome
    measure may be undertaken at Review for a number of reasons including:

      health status;

.. _dfn-collection_occasion_key:

.. _dfn-episode_key:

Episode Key
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a number or code assigned to each PMHC MDS episode. The Episode Key is unique and stable for each episode at the level of the organisation. This key must link to an existing episode within the PMHC MDS.

:Field name: episode_key

:Data type: string (2,50)

:Required: yes
:Notes:
  Episode Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the provider
  organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of episode keys in
  this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
  identified) without having to re-allocate episode identifiers since they can
  never clash.
  
  A recommended approach for the creation of Episode Keys is to compute `random
  UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.

  The Initial Needs Identification (INI) is a screening process where the underlying issues as well as the presenting issues are uncovered to the extent possible. It is not a diagnostic process but is a determination of the client's risk, eligibility and priority for service, a balancing for the service capacity and client needs
  Needs identification can occur via phone, face-to-face interaction or written survey intervention. However, Needs Identification is ongoing and as a client receives care, other needs or circumstances may be identified which require attention by other disciplines. External referral or re-entry onto the waiting list to access the other disciplines may then occur. This question allows for more than one response. The INI must be administered at a minimum at the following points of service participation:
  
  * At the start of The Way Back
  * At the six-week or mid-point of the expected support period
  * At exit from the service

:Field name: reason_for_collection

  *	Needs Identification
  * Outcome Measures (K10, WHO-5, SIDAS )
  
  1 - Episode start
    Refers to a service activity undertaken at the beginning of an Episode of
    Care. For the purposes of the PMHC MDS protocol, episodes may start at the
    point of first Service Contact with a new client who has not been seen
    previously by the organisation, or a first contact for a new Episode of
    Care for a client who has received services from the organisation in a
    previous Episode of Care that has been completed.
  
  2 - Review
    Refers to a service activity undertaken during the course of an Episode of
    Care that post-dates Episode Start and pre-dates Episode End. A service
    activity may be undertaken at Review for a number of reasons including:
  
    - in response to critical clinical events or changes in the client’s mental
      health status;
    - following a client-requested review; or
    - other situations where a review may be indicated.
  
  3 - Episode end
    Refers to the service activities collected at the end of an Episode of Care.

.. _dfn-collection_occasion_tags:

Collection Occasion - Tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List of tags for the collection occasion.

:Field name: collection_occasion_tags

:Data type: string

:Required: no
:Notes:
  A comma separated list of tags.
  
  Organisations can use this field to tag records in order to partition them as
  per local requirements.
  
  Tags can contain lower case letters (or will get lowercased), numbers, dashes,
  spaces, and ``!``. Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped. e.g. ``priority!,
  nurse required, pending-outcome-1`` would all be legitimate.
  
  Tags beginning with an exclamation mark (!) are reserved for future use by the
  Department. e.g. ``!reserved, ! reserved, !department-use-only``.

.. _dfn-collection_occasion_key:

Collection Occasion Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a number or code assigned to each collection occasion of service activities. The Collection Occasion Key is unique and stable for each collection occasion at the level of the organisation.

----------

.. _dfn-episode_key:

Episode Key
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a number or code assigned to each PMHC MDS episode. The Episode Key is unique and stable for each episode at the level of the organisation. This key must link to an existing episode within the PMHC MDS.

:Field name: episode_key

:Data type: string (2,50)

:Required: yes
:Notes:
  Episode Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the provider
  organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of episode keys in
  this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
  identified) without having to re-allocate episode identifiers since they can
  never clash.
  
  A recommended approach for the creation of Episode Keys is to compute `random
  UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.

  **Reporting requirements**
  The Needs Identification (NI) is a screening process where the psychosocial
  needs of a client are identified. It provides the basis for the creation of a
  Support Plan and is considered a useful way to help understand client support
  needs and service goals.  The needs identified through this process should
  inform the client’s goals and recommendations to community-based services.
  
  The NI must be administered at a minimum at the following points of service participation:
  
  * At the start of The Way Back
  * At the six-week or mid-point of the expected support period
  * At exit from the service

:Notes:
  **1 - Safety Plan**
  
  Clients referred to The Way Back may have commenced the process of safety
  planning as part of their discussions with Emergency Department or Ward staff.
  Any existing safety plans completed by hospital or staff should be shared with
  or requested by The Way Back service provider and updated as part of
  preliminary discussions with The Way Back clients.
  Where clients referred to The Way Back have not completed any safety planning
  prior to their referral this should be completed as a priority once the client
  has consented to participate in The Way Back.
  
  Safety Plans must be updated/developed within the first contact with the
  client and no later than the second contact. Safety plans should be reviewed
  with a client as needed. Each instance of the review and update of a safety
  plan should be recorded.
  
  Service Providers should choose the most appropriate Support Plan template for
  their service. The TWB Tools and Templates provide a sample of one and there
  is also the BeyondNow app.
  
  **2 - Support Plan**
  
  All Way Back service providers must work collaboratively with their clients
  to develop a Support Plan that articulates:
  
  * the client’s **needs** as assessed using the Support Tools
  * the client’s **goals** of participating in The Way Back
  * proposed **actions and interventions** planned to address identified needs
    and goals including referrals to be made
  
  In developing a Support Plan, discussion with clients should consider warning
  signs, strengths, support mechanisms and strategies that have enabled them to
  take the next steps. Needs Identified in this process are to be grouped and
  reported in the TWB NI data collection.
  
  A Support Plan must be completed with a client within two weeks of their
  consenting to participate in the service. To identify a client’s needs and
  build an understanding of what support will be of benefit, all Support Tools
  and Measures should be completed prior to completing the Support Plan.
  Support Plans are also required to be reviewed at 6 weeks, or a regular basis
  throughout the support period to ensure that strategies are current and upon
  Service Exit. Each review must be documented.

  agencies from which they most frequently send recommendations and note the

  Report the Recommendation starting with the most relevant or urgent one first.

MDS Roles available for NSPT Users

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles. The following table provides a summary of each of
the roles that currently exist within the PMHC MDS:

+----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Each role allows a user to perform specific tasks. A user can have more than one role.
Each role is granted for a user against an organisation. An organisation can
either be a Primary Health Network or a provider organisation. If a user is granted
a role for a Primary Health Network (PHN) they will also have this role for any
provider organisation's of that PHN. A user can be invited to have a role at more
than one organisations. There is no limit to the number of users per organisation.

What users see once they are logged in will depend upon what roles they have been
assigned. The table below lists the tabs that will be shown for each role:

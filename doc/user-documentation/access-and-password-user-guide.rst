==================

The Way Back (TWB) is an extension of the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS);
current PMHC MDS online User Guide is available to be viewed for the following information.

.. _home:

Access
------

Each individual staff member should be set up with their own unique login access.
User accounts can be created by a user at your provider organisation, or PHN, who
has the User Management role. If unsure who this is, please contact
support@pmhc-mds.com to find out who has this access.

Information on 'Accepting an invitation to become a PMHC MDS User', 'Logging In',
and 'Logging Out', and 'Updating your details', is available at https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/home.html.

.. _passwords:

Passwords
---------

Password information, including 'Passwords Requirements', 'Password Expiry Notifications',
and 'Forgotten or Expired Password', is available at https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/home.html.

.. _roles:

MDS Roles available for TWB Users
---------------------------------

Access to the PMHC MDS is based around roles. What users see once they are logged
in will depend upon what roles they have been assigned. The roles that currently
exist within the PMHC MDS, is available at https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/users.html#users-roles.

The Way Back (TWB) extension will be available on the following roles through the next stages of development:

Evaluation of NSPT
==================

The University of Melbourne's Evaluation of the National Suicide Prevention Trial data.

.. _evaluation-aims:

Evaluation Aims
---------------

The evaluation aims to gather and analyse information from the National Suicide Prevention Trial sites to determine what strategies are effective in preventing suicide in at-risk populations, and to consider the implications of these findings for future suicide prevention activities.

.. _evaluation-question:

Evaluation Questions
--------------------

The evaluation is guided by five overarching questions:

1.	What strategies were used by sites to plan suicide prevention services and community-based activities and to ensure that these respond to local needs?

2.	What are the key factors in the development of a systems-based approach to suicide prevention and what are the barriers to effective service integration?

3.	How were activities targeting people who have attempted suicide and those assessed as at risk of suicide enhanced, and were the enhanced services effective?

4.	What strategies were found to be most effective in each of the target populations?

5.	What are the implications for future Australian Government and national suicide prevention policy?

Evaluation Design
-----------------

The evaluation design is guided by the Evaluation Framework developed by the Department of Health.  Taking a mixed-methods approach, the evaluation will collect both quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of data sources. There are three sources of quantitative data:

1.	Routinely collected data from the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC) will be analysed.

2.	An additional trial-specific module has been developed for the PMHC minimum dataset to collect information required for the evaluation that is not currently captured in the PMHC minimum dataset. The items include a few additional socio-demographic and referral items as well as a brief outcome scale for suicidal thinking.

3.	Community-based Activity data will be collected using, a data collection template that captures basic descriptive information about the activity and the number of attendees.

Qualitative data will be collected from stakeholder consultations with PHNs, community representatives, service providers and people with lived experience, document review, local evaluation reports, observation/participation, a consumer survey and other inputs.

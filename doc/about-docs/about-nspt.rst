**The National Suicide Prevention Trial**

The National Suicide Prevention Trial (NSPT) aims to gather evidence in relation
to suicide prevention activities in local geographical areas of Australia and to
further understanding of what strategies are most effective in preventing suicide
in at-risk populations.

Its objective is to provide evidence of how a more systems-based approach to
suicide prevention might best be undertaken within the Australian context and to
identify new learnings in relation to suicide prevention in at-risk populations.

The trial has been funded by the Department of Health, from 2016-2020
and is being run by 11 Primary Health Networks in 12 sites across Australia.

Seven priority at-risk populations have been identified:

* people who have made a suicide attempt or at-risk for suicide,
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,
* men aged 25-65,
* people aged 65 years and older,
* veterans,
* LGBTI people,
* and young people.

Trial sites are working with communities to assess suicide prevention needs in
local areas and in priority populations and to implement a range of evidence-based
programs  to address those needs.  Programs include community-based activities
such as training for General Practitioners and other health workers, training
for community leaders, peer support training, cultural programs for Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders, as well as services for individuals such as aftercare
programs following a suicide attempt.

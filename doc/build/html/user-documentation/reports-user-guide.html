<p>The Way Back Quarterly reporting function allows users to automatically populate
The Way Back Quarterly Report using data contained in the PMHC MDS. This spreadsheet
will then require some manual completion of information not available to the
PMHC-MDS system before providing to Beyond Blue or your PHN.</p>
<p>Many of the items reported are summarised over two time periods - reporting
period and year to date. The former is always a full quarter worth of data
as selected in the drop down boxes on the report generation page, unless the
most recent quarter has been selected in which case it will be all data from
the start of the current quarter until the day the report is generated.
Financial years are listed in the report dropdowns with both relevant calendar
years listed (e.g. <strong>2020 - 2021</strong>). The year to date figure is always from
July 1 of the earlier calendar year until either the end of the selected
reporting period or the date the report was generated if the current quarter
is selected.</p>
<p>The first section of the report explicitly details the dates covered by the
reporting period and the year to date, as well as identifying the time at which
it was generated.</p>

<h3>Client Measures and Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#client-measures-and-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Information about three clinical measures is reported in this section. For each
measure there are three summary statistics:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) initial measures collected during the
reporting period</p></li>
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) final measures collected during the
reporting period</p></li>
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) final measures collected during the
reporting period that also have (valid) initial measures (not necessarily
during the reporting period)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Information about collection occasions - including dates and reasons - is
available <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#collection-occasion">in the Collection Occasion specification documentation</a>.
A critical feature of a collection occasion is its “reason”, which is actually
about the point in the clients’ journey when the measure was taken. For
reporting purposes this can be either “inital” (i.e. start of the episode) or
final (end of the episode). Note however that the collection occasion dates
need not be the same as the episode start and end dates. Measures can be
collected on any day.</p>
<p>The specific measures of interest are the K10+, the WHO-5, and the SIDAS.
Information about these measures - including what constitutes a valid measure
- can be accessed <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/key-concepts.html#collection-occasion">in the Collection Occasion Key Concepts documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Although there should be no cases where an episode has multiple instances of
a particular measure taken at any collection occasion identified as initial
or final, if such an anomaly occurs the CO is still included as having the
initial/final/paired measure. In other words the technical definition of
“having a measure” is interpreted as “having one or more instances of the
relevant measure”.</p>

<h3>Key Performance Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#key-performance-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The KPIs produced by the automated reports are all based on particular events
occurring within a certain number of days of a precipitating event. KPIs
pertain to the reporting period only.</p>
<p>Each KPI reports a reference population (the number in the ‘Calc B’ column)
and the subset of that population that meets the criteria in the ‘Target Metric’
column (‘Calc A’). Note that a population in this case means a count of
episodes, not a number of people.  The ratio is presented as a percentage
in the ‘% Achieved During’ column.</p>
<p>Business days are defined as Monday to Friday inclusive, unless they are
listed in <a class="reference external" href="http://public_holidays.csv">this document</a> which has been derived

territory of the service). A week is defined as 5 business days.</p>

<p>The W2 provides an overview of The Way Back (TWB) activity undertaken during the reporting period. It uses the same assumptions as the standard A1 report. It is a ‘one page’ view, with data aggregated for the specified reporting period, covering counts of clients, episodes and service contacts.</p>
<p>Key specifications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data in this report is all associated with an Active TWB Episode, as shown in the ‘Active Episodes’ column counts. This means the episode must appear in the <a class="reference internal" href="../data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#data-model"><span class="std std-ref">TWB Episode table</span></a>, and must have an Active Contact during the reporting period. A !`wayback` tag on the main episode table is NOT sufficient for the episode to be included in this report.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Active Contacts’ column counts all the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/data-model-and-specifications.html#attended-service-contact">attended service contacts</a> (i.e. non-no show) that occurred during the reporting period that were associated with an Active TWB Episode.</p></li>

<p>The W3 is a summary The Way Back (TWB) format report that provides a simple listing of missing/invalid data rates for relevant TWB Episode data elements. It is analogous to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/user-documentation/en/latest/reporting.html#a4-data-quality-report-missing-and-invalid-episode-data">standard A4 report</a> that deals with the standard PMHC Episode elements with missing data.</p>
<p>Key specifications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As for the W2, data in this report is all associated with an Active TWB Episode; however, for this report there is slightly tighter criteria regarding what it means to be active. Rather than the usual one or more <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/data-model-and-specifications.html#attended-service-contact">attended service contact</a> during the reporting period, for the W3 and W4, there must be at least TWO such contacts (i.e. non-no shows) during the reporting period). The episode must appear in the <a class="reference internal" href="../data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#data-model"><span class="std std-ref">TWB Episode table</span></a>. This number is reported in the column labelled ‘Number of active episodes in period’.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Number of active episodes with missing data’ column counts, separately for each of the TWB Episode record elements, how many episodes have the pertinent missing value code. For the elements “Method of Suicide Attempt” and “Primary Nominated Professional”, ‘Other’ (code 98) is counted as a missing value as well as ‘Not stated/Inadequately described’ (code 99).</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘% Missing Data’ column is a simple percentage of the active episodes that have missing data, calculated from the preceding two columns.</p></li>

<p>The W4 is a summary The Way Back (TWB) format report that provides a simple listing of missing/invalid data rates for relevant TWB Needs Identification and TWB Recommendation Outs data elements.

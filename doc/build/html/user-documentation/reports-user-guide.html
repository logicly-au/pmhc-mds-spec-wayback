<p>Many of the items reported are summarised over two time periods - reporting
period and year to date. The former is always a full quarter worth of data
as selected in the drop down boxes on the report generation page, unless the
most recent quarter has been selected in which case it will be all data from
the start of the current quarter until the day the report is generated.
Financial years are listed in the report dropdowns with both relevant calendar
years listed (e.g. <strong>2020 - 2021</strong>). The year to date figure is always from
July 1 of the earlier calendar year until either the end of the selected
reporting period or the date the report was generated if the current quarter
is selected.</p>
<p>The first section of the report explicitly details the dates covered by the
reporting period and the year to date, as well as identifying the time at which
it was generated.</p>

<h3>Client Measures and Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#client-measures-and-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Information about three clinical measures is reported in this section. For each
measure there are three summary statistics:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) initial measures collected during the
reporting period</p></li>
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) final measures collected during the
reporting period</p></li>
<li><p>The number of episodes with (valid) final measures collected during the
reporting period that also have (valid) initial measures (not necessarily
during the reporting period)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Information about collection occasions - including dates and reasons - is
available <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/data-model-and-specifications.html#collection-occasion">in the Collection Occasion specification documentation</a>.
A critical feature of a collection occasion is its “reason”, which is actually
about the point in the clients’ journey when the measure was taken. For
reporting purposes this can be either “inital” (i.e. start of the episode) or
final (end of the episode). Note however that the collection occasion dates
need not be the same as the episode start and end dates. Measures can be
collected on any day.</p>
<p>The specific measures of interest are the K10+, the WHO-5, and the SIDAS.
Information about these measures - including what constitutes a valid measure
- can be accessed <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification-wayback/en/v3/data-specification/key-concepts.html#collection-occasion">in the Collection Occasion Key Concepts documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Although there should be no cases where an episode has multiple instances of
a particular measure taken at any collection occasion identified as initial
or final, if such an anomaly occurs the CO is still included as having the
initial/final/paired measure. In other words the technical definition of
“having a measure” is interpreted as “having one or more instances of the
relevant measure”.</p>

<p>The KPIs produced by the automated reports are all based on particular events
occurring within a certain number of days of a precipitating event. KPIs
pertain to the reporting period only.</p>
<p>Each KPI reports a reference population (the number in the ‘Calc B’ column)
and the subset of that population that meets the criteria in the ‘Target Metric’
column (‘Calc A’). Note that a population in this case means a count of
episodes, not a number of people.  The ratio is presented as a percentage
in the ‘% Achieved During’ column.</p>

Who is in the NSPT Evaluation Project Team

See: :ref:`evaluation_project_team`

What is the NSPT evaluation about?
----------------------------------

The Department of Health is funding Primary Health Networks (PHNs) in 12 areas across the country to try and improve services for people who are experiencing thoughts of suicide or who have recently made a suicide attempt. This program is called the National Suicide Prevention Trial.

The evaluation aims to gather and analyse information from the National Suicide Prevention Trial sites to determine what strategies are effective in preventing suicide in at-risk populations, and to consider the implications of these findings for future suicide prevention activities.

What will happen to client information?
---------------------------------------

If a client agrees, Strategic Data will link the NSPT Individual Services NSPT Trial data with the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) and de-identified data will be sent to the University of Melbourne researchers. At the University, that information will be held under password protection and only members of the evaluation team will have access to it.

The University of Melbourne will protect the confidentiality of client data, subject to any legal requirements.

The University of Melbourne will store the information collected for at least five years after the study, but none of the client information will be identifiable or be able to be traced back to an individual.
